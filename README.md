# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learing-FYP

In this project I built a desktop application antivirus which is able to detect malware and block them to protect operating system and user data. I used a technique called PE file Analysis to create our data set of malware and clean files and then used some machine learning models to classify between malware and legitimate files.

# Steps to run
