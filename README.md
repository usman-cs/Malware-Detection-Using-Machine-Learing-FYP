# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learing-FYP
Desktop Application for Malware Detection Based on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

In this project I built a desktop application antivirus which is able to detect malware and block them to protect 
operating system and user data. We used a technique called PE file Analysisto create our data set of malware and clean files
and then used some machine learning models to classify between malware and legitimate files.
